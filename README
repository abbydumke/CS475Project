## Background
A trip to Disney World is a dream vacation for many worldwide. With four theme parks and two
water parks filled with attractions, shows, restaurants, and shops, planning this magical 
experience can be challenging, especially considering the high costs associated with "the most 
magical place on earth". Disney World mandates reservations for theme park admissions and
table-service dining, making it essential to carefully plan these reservations to maximize what 
Disney has to offer. With average monthly wait times ranging from 30 to over 45 minutes and 
individual ride wait times varying from 5 to over 100 minutes, strategic timing is crucial 
(ThrillData). Selecting not only the right time to visit Disney World but also the time of day for
specific rides is key to enhancing your overall experience.

The My Disney Experience app displays real-time wait times for rides at all theme parks, but 
lacks data on average wait times per ride. Given the various factors that influence vacation 
planning, such as wait times and reservations, I believe that the creation of a data visualization 
tool that would allow users to compare monthly hourly average wait times for individual rides, 
would be great for planning purposes.

## Goal
I will consider these questions throughout my project:
1. Are there hourly trends for wait times on different rides?
2. Can using ride time data optimize for planning optimize one's trip
to Disney World?

I propose the creation of a data visualization tool that enables users to compare wait times based
on individual rides. I want to gather data from the past year (February 2023- January 2024) and
get the monthly hourly average wait times per ride. With this data, I want to make a visualization
tool where I can select a specific month, then select specific rides, and compare the queue time. 
I believe that this could be extremely helpful when making reservations. For example, if I wanted 
to make meal reservations at a table service restaurant, I can go on this data tool, select the 
month I will be traveling, click the rides I want to go on, and if there is a specific time where all of 
the rides I want to go on are very high, I will make meal plans then. Or another example, if I am 
going to multiple parks in one day, I can go on this data tool, select the month I will be traveling,
click the rides from different parks I want to go on, and see if there is a longer wait time for those 
rides at a specific time of day. 

I think that having a tool like this could potentially ease the planning and maximize oneâ€™s trip to 
Disney World. I know that there will be a definite change in time of year (monthly averages), but I 
am hoping to find trends based on time of day. Ideally, I would like to include all rides at Disney 
World; however, since there are so many attractions, it might be challenging to include all of 
them. I will start by gathering data for the most popular rides at each park, and if I have time I can 
get the data for more rides.
