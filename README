# Background
A trip to Disney World is a dream vacation for many worldwide. With four theme parks and two
water parks filled with attractions, shows, restaurants, and shops, planning this magical 
experience can be challenging, especially considering the high costs associated with "the most 
magical place on earth". Disney World mandates reservations for theme park admissions and
table-service dining, making it essential to carefully plan these reservations to maximize what 
Disney has to offer. With average monthly wait times ranging from 30 to over 45 minutes and 
individual ride wait times varying from 5 to over 100 minutes, strategic timing is crucial 
(ThrillData). Selecting not only the right time to visit Disney World but also the time of day for
specific rides is key to enhancing your overall experience.
