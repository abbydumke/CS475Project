# Background
A trip to Disney World is a dream vacation for many worldwide. With four theme parks and two
water parks filled with attractions, shows, restaurants, and shops, planning this magical 
experience can be challenging, especially considering the high costs associated with "the most 
magical place on earth". Disney World mandates reservations for theme park admissions and
table-service dining, making it essential to carefully plan these reservations to maximize what 
Disney has to offer. With average monthly wait times ranging from 30 to over 45 minutes and 
individual ride wait times varying from 5 to over 100 minutes, strategic timing is crucial 
(ThrillData). Selecting not only the right time to visit Disney World but also the time of day for
specific rides is key to enhancing your overall experience.

The My Disney Experience app displays real-time wait times for rides at all theme parks, but 
lacks data on average wait times per ride. Given the various factors that influence vacation 
planning, such as wait times and reservations, I believe that the creation of a data visualization 
tool that would allow users to compare monthly hourly average wait times for individual rides, 
would be great for planning purposes.
